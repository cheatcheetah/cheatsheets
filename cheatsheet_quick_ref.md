This cheat sheet contains examples of how differents markdown tags are rendered. For instance this is a regular text, not nested inside any headers tag.

If you want to see what the source of this

# I am a `h1`

This is how a paragraph inside an `h1` section is displayed.

If you slide your mouse on the title above, you'll see that you can copy a link to that section.

## I'm a `h2`
{: .-three-column}

Some text inside `h2`.
Note that this `h2` has the `{: .-three-column}` options set.

### I'm a `h3`

And I'm some text inside a `h3`. As you can see, everything inside an `h3` is displayed inside a container.

### Hey I'm a `h3` too!

Inside `h3`s, the main options are the following.

You can display lists:

- Some ...
- ... list ...
- ... elements!

Or some code:

```text
Some code
```

Finally, note that [links](#im-a-h2) are supported too.

### ... and me too!

#### I'm an `h4`

You can see that `h4`s are not used as containers, but as `p` with emphasis.

And that's all you'll need to create your own cheat sheets!
